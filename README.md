#levenshtein-benchmark

> Simple benchmark for diffrent levenshtein algorithms using real-life data

## Installation

```shell
npm install levenshtein-benchmark
```

## How to run

#### Use as a module

```javascript
var benchmark = require('levenshtein-benchmark');
var editdistance = require("editdistance");

function Dis(str1) {
	this._dis = editdistance(str1);
}
Dis.prototype.distance = function (str2) {
	return this._dis.distance(str2);
}

var bench = benchmark(Dis);

bench.on('progress', function (key) {
	console.log('finished parsing ' + key + '.html');
});

bench.on('result', function (stat) {
	console.log(stat.mean().toPrecision(6) + ' ms/file Â± ' + stat.sd().toPrecision(6));
});
```

Where `stat` is a [Summary](https://github.com/AndreasMadsen/summary) object.

#### Use the script

You can also just run `npm test`, that will benchmark all the modules listed
in the `wrapper` directory. Note that you will need to install the `dev-dependencies`
first.

```shell
cd htmlparser-benchmark
npm install
npm test
```
